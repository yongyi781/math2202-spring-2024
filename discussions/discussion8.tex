  The TA will demonstrate 1(a) and 1(b).

  \begin{problem}
    In this example you will calculate the minimum distance from the rectangular hyperbola $xy=1$ to the origin. (Because this problem probably appeals very strongly to your geometric intuition, you will have a good way to check if your final answer is correct.) Here is the problem expressed as a Lagrange multipliers problem.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
      \item Explain why finding the global minimum of $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=xy-1=0$ will calculate the minimum distance between the hyperbola and the origin $(0,0)$.
      \item Calculate the two gradient vectors $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$.
      \item Create and solve the system of equations $\nabla f=\lambda\nabla g$.
      \item Evaluate $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ at each point you found.
      \item What is the minimum distance from the hyperbola to the point $(0,0)$? Does this agree with your geometric intuition?
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}
    Do the steps of Problem 2 but for the problem of finding the point on the 3-dimensional hyperbola thingy with equation $xyz=1$ closest to the origin. Here's a picture of this thingy. It is actually pretty weird.

    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
      \item Explain why finding the global minimum of $f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y,z)=xyz-1=0$ will calculate the minimum distance between the 3D hyperbola thingy and the origin $(0,0)$.
      \item Calculate the two gradient vectors $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$.
      \item Create and solve the system of equations $\nabla f=\lambda\nabla g$.
      \item Evaluate $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2+z^2$ at each point you found.
      \item What is the minimum distance from the hyperbola to the point $(0,0)$? Does this agree with your geometric intuition?
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}
    Iterated integrals for practice.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
      \item Integrate
      \[\int_0^3\int_1^2(x^2+3y^2)\,dy\,dx.\]
      \item Integrate $x+y$ over this region:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
          \draw[->] (-1,0) -- (2,0) node[right] {$x$};
          \draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,2) node[above] {$y$};
          \foreach \x in {-1,1,2}
            \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {$\x$};
          \foreach \y in {-1,1}
            \draw (0.1,\y) -- (-0.1,\y) node[left] {$\y$};
          \fill (0,0) -- (2,0) -- (1,1) -- cycle;
        \end{tikzpicture}
      \end{center}
      Which order of integration allows you to express the computation with only one integral?
      \item Integrate $e^{-x-y}$ over the infinite region $x\geq 1,y\geq 1$. (Answer: $1/e^2$)
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{problem}

  \begin{problem}[Challenge]
    Express the volume of the unit sphere as a triple iterated integral in $x,y,z$ coordinate. If you choose to evaluate it, you can compare your answer against the known answer of $4\pi/3$. We'll talk more about this on Wednesday's class.
