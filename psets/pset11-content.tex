\section{Practice problem bonanza}
For the final problem set, you get to make up points missed on your lowest homework grade by doing problems from the textbook. Pick and submit as many practice problems as you want from the book. You gain one point per problem. The rules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not pick problems that appeared in previous homework.
  \item Label the section and problem number very clearly (e.g.\ Problem 13.5.22).
  \item At most two practice problems per section.
  \item Check the Canvas homepage for exactly what sections we've covered.
\end{itemize}
If done properly, this also doubles as part of your final studying. Choose sections you feel the least comfortable in!
