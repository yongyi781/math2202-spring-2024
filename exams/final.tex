% Vector fields, easy
\begin{problem}
  Let $\BF(x,y,z)=(y^2-z^2)\bi+(x^2-z^2)\bj+(x^2-y^2)\bk$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (3 points) Calculate the curl of $\BF$.
    \vfil
    \item (3 points) Calculate the divergence of the answer you got in part (a).
    \vfil
    \item (4 points) If you were to use a different vector field $\BF$ in this problem, would you expect the answer to part (b) to be the same as before? Explain why or why not.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage

% Partial derivatives, easy
\begin{problem}
  Let $f(x,y)=-x^3+3xy^2+3x^2+3y^2+1$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (5 points) Find all critical points of $f(x,y)$.
    \vfil
    \item (5 points) Using the second derivative test, determine the nature of the critical point $(0,0)$. You do not need to check other critical points.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage

% Planes, easy
\begin{problem}[10 points]
  Consider two planes $P$ and $Q$: The plane $P$ is the graph of the function $f(x,y)=2x-y+1$, and the plane $Q$ is the graph of the function $g(x,y)=5-y$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (5 points) Give normal vectors for $P$ and $Q$.
    \vfil
    \item (5 points) The two planes $P$ and $Q$ intersect in some line $\ell$. Give a parametrization of $\ell$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage

% Lagrange multipliers, easy
\begin{problem}
  Consider the functions $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ and $g(x,y)=2x+4y$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (2 points) Calculate $\nabla f$ and $\nabla g$.
    \vfil
    \item (6 points) There is one extreme value of $f(x,y)$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y)=5$. Find it using Lagrange multipliers.
    \vfil
    \vfil
    \item (2 points) Is the extreme value a maximum or minimum? Explain.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

% Polar coordinates, easy
\begin{problem}
  A curve $\C$ in the plane is given by the parametrization
  \[\br(t)=t\cos(t)\bi + t\sin(t)\bj,\quad t\geq 0.\]
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (5 points) Show (algebraically) that that the trajectory of the curve is precisely the Archimedean spiral $r=\theta$.
    \vfil
    \item (5 points) Using the parametrization $\br(t)$, write an integral that represents the arc length of the Archimedean spiral from $\theta=0$ to $\theta=6\pi$. Do not evaluate.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage

% Integral, easy
\begin{problem}
  Consider the following double integral.
  \[\iint_\cR (x^2+y^2)\,dA,\quad\cR=\{(x,y)\mid 0\leq x+2y\leq 1,\ 0\leq 2x-y\leq 1\}.\]
  It turns out that the region $\cR$ is a rotated square, so it is difficult to integrate on it as is. We shall solve this problem using a change of coordinates.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (3 points) Let $x=u+2v,\ y=2u-v$. Show that $\cR$ can be written in $uv$-coordinates as
    \[\cR_{u,v}=\left\{(u,v) \ \middle|\  0\leq u\leq \frac15,\ 0\leq v\leq \frac15 \right\}.\]
    \vfil
    \item (3 points) Calculate the Jacobian for the transformation $dx\,dy\to du\,dv$.
    \newpage
    \item (4 points) With the help of part (b), rewrite the integral $\iint_\cR (x^2+y^2)\,dA$ in the form
    \[\int_{\boxed ?}^{\boxed ?}\int_{\boxed ?}^{\boxed ?}\boxed ?\,du\,dv.\]
    Do not evaluate it, but if it helps, the answer turns out to be $\frac2{75}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage

% Green's theorem, medium
\begin{problem}[10 points]
  Let $\cR$ be a region in the plane. Recall (13.5.4) says
  \[\operatorname{Area}(\cR)=\frac12\oint_{\partial R}(-y\,dx+x\,dy).\]
  Prove that the following simpler formula in fact also holds for any region $\cR$.
  \[\operatorname{Area}(\cR)=\oint_{\partial R}x\,dy.\]
\end{problem}

\newpage

% Vector-valued functions, medium
\begin{problem}[10 points]
  An ellipse $E$ is given by the equation $\frac{x^2}{9}+\frac{y^2}{4}=1$. It has a semi-major axis of length 3 and semi-minor axis of length 2. We want to find a parametric representation of the ellipse $E$, given by $\br(t)$, that satisfies the following conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\br(t)$ lies on $E$ for all values of $t$.
    \item $\br(0)=(0,-2)$.
    \item $\|\br'(0)\|=42$.
  \end{itemize}
  Provide such a parametric representation $\br(t)$ and show that it satisfies the given conditions.
\end{problem}

\newpage

% Spherical coordinates, medium
\begin{problem}
  Let $\C$ be the cone $z^2=7x^2+7y^2,\ z\geq 0$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (5 points) Show that $\C$, when expressed in spherical coordinates, has the simple equation $\phi=\tan^{-1}\frac1{\sqrt7}$.
    \newpage
    \item (5 points) Recall that $\C$ is the cone $z^2=7x^2+7y^2,\ z\geq 0$. Consider the region $\U$ bounded by $\C$ and the two planes $z=1$ and $z=2$, as in Figure~\ref{fig:cone}.

    Write down an iterated integral that calculates the volume of $\U$ using spherical coordinates. Do not evaluate it, but if it helps, the answer turns out to be $\frac\pi3$.
  \end{enumerate}

% Vector fields, medium
\begin{problem}
  Let $\BF$ be the vector field $z\bi+x\bj+y\bk$. Let $\br(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t)),\ a\leq t\leq b$ be any integral curve of $\BF$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (5 points) What system of differential equations must $x(t),y(t),z(t)$ satisfy?
    \vfil
    \item (5 points) Show that no matter what integral curve $\br(t)$ is picked for $\BF$, if $\C$ is the directed curve traced out by $\br(t)$ for $a\leq t\leq b$, then we will always have
    \[\int_\C \BF\cdot d\br\geq 0.\]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
